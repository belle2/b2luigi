    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="(b2)luigi tasks are defined as classes that inherit from a luigi task class, for this example we will start with a basic class that inherits from b2luigi.Task. The task class should define the parameters, the run method, and the output method. The parameters are defined as class attributes, and the run method contains the actual computation. The output method defines the output of the task, which is used to determine if the task has been completed.">
