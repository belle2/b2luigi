Building a dependency graph with b2luigi
========================================

.. hint::
    This example demonstrates the third key method of a ``b2luigi`` task: the ``requires`` method.
    This method is used to define dependencies between different tasks.

The ``requires`` method is used to define dependencies between different tasks.
The method should return iterable instances of the required tasks.
This task will be scheduled to run after the output of the required taskis completed.
The output is considered completed if the output files is present.

.. warning::
    There is no check of the content of the output files!
    Consequently, the previous task can be forced to rerun by deleting the output.

To show the functionality of the ``requires`` method, we will create a second task that depends on the first task.
For this, we define the first task in the same way as in the previous example.

.. code-block:: Python

    import b2luigi
    class MyTask(b2luigi.Task):
        parameter = b2luigi.IntParameter()

        def run(self):
            with open(self.get_output_file_name("output.txt"), "w") as f:
                f.write(f"{self.parameter}")

        def output(self):
            yield self.add_to_output("output.txt")


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 33-47

Here, we again make use of the :meth:`b2luigi.add_to_output` method to add
another output file in the now existing directory structure. In this
example, the output is structered as follows:

.. code-block:: none

  parameter=1/
    output.txt
    output2.txt

We use :meth:`b2luigi.Task.get_input_file_names` to get the file name of
the output file of the required task. The method returns an iterable
of file names. In this case, we know that there is only one file
present and we can access it by accessing the first element.

.. code-block:: Python

    class MyOtherTask(b2luigi.Task):
        parameter = b2luigi.IntParameter()

        def requires(self):
            return MyTask(parameter=self.parameter)

        def output(self):
            yield self.add_to_output("output2.txt")

        def run(self):
            with open(self.get_input_file_names("output.txt")[0], "r") as f:
                number = int(f.read())

            with open(self.get_output_file_name("output2.txt"), "w") as f:
                f.write(f"{number**2}")


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 66-70

For the process method, we now have to call the new task. The scheduler
will automatically resolve the dependencies between the tasks. If the
output of `MyTask` is not present, it will be executed first. As soon as,
the output is present, `MyOtherTask` will be executed.

.. code-block:: Python

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        b2luigi.process(MyOtherTask(parameter=1))


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 74-77

You can try to adjust the value in "parameter=1'/output.txt", delete the
output of ``MyOtherTask`` and rerun the script to see how this affects the
result of the tasks.
