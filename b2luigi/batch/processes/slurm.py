        With Slurm, you can check the progress of your jobs using the ``squeue`` command.
        If no ``jobID`` is given as argument, this command shows you the status of all queued jobs.

        Sometimes it might happen that a job is completed in between the status checks. Then its final status
        can be found using ``sacct`` (works mostly in the same way as ``squeue``).

        If in the unlikely case the server has the Slurm accounting disabled, then the `scontrol` command is used as a last
        resort to access the jobs history. This is the fail safe command as the scontrol by design only holds onto a jobs
        information for a short period of time after completion. The time between status checks is sufficiently short however
        so the scontrol command should still have the jobs information on hand.

        All three commands are used in order to find out the :obj:`SlurmJobStatus`.

    Reference implementation of the batch process for a Slurm batch system.

    Additional to the basic batch setup (see :ref:`batch-label`), additional
    Slurm-specific things are:

    * Please note that most of the Slurm batch farms by default copy the user environment from
      the submission node to the worker machine. As this can lead to different results when running
      the same tasks depending on your active environment, you probably want to pass the argument
      ``export=NONE``. This ensures that a reproducible environment is used. You can provide an
      ``env_script``, an ``env`` :meth:`setting <b2luigi.set_setting>`, and/or a different
      ``executable`` to create the environment necessary for your task.

    * Via the ``slurm_settings`` setting you can provide a dict for additional options, such as
      requested memory etc. Its value has to be a dictionary
      containing Slurm settings as key/value pairs. These options will be written into the job
      submission file. For an overview of possible settings refer to the `Slurm documentation
      <https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html#>_` and the documentation of the cluster you are using.

    * Same as for the :ref:`lsf` and :ref:`htcondor`, the ``job_name`` setting allows giving a meaningful
      name to a group of jobs. If you want to be task-instance-specific, you can provide the ``job-name``
      as an entry in the ``slurm_settings`` dict, which will override the global ``job_name`` setting.
      This is useful for manually checking the status of specific jobs with

      .. code-block:: bash

        squeue --name <job name>
