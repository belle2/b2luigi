class Gbasf2Process(BatchProcess):
    """
    Batch process for working with ``gbasf2`` projects on the *LHC Computing Grid* (LCG).

    Features
        - **``gbasf2`` project submission**

          The ``gbasf2`` batch process takes the ``basf2`` path returned by the
          :meth:`create_path <b2luigi.basf2_helper.tasks.Basf2PathTask.create_path>` method of
          the task, saves it into a pickle file to
          the disk and creates a wrapper steering file that executes the saved
          path. Any ``basf2`` variable aliases added in the ``Path()`` or ``create_path()`` method
          are also stored in the pickle file. It then sends both the pickle file
          and the steering file wrapper to the grid via the Belle II-specific
          DIRAC-wrapper ``gbasf2``.
          However, ``b2luigi`` supports the submission of custom steering files with the setting
          ``gbasf2_custom_steering_file``. This conserves the way that the ``basf2`` path os still contained in the ``create_path()`` method. In this instance,
          ``b2luigi``checks automatically if the corresponding file exists and copies it into the
          active directory. The ``gbasf2`` task is then set to submit the unpickled file to the grid job
          which allows the utilization of python-based basf2 modules.

        - **Project status monitoring**

          After the project submission, the gbasf batch process regularly checks the status
          of all the jobs belonging to a ``gbasf2`` project returns a success if
          all jobs had been successful, while a single failed job results in a failed project.
          You can close a running ``b2luigi`` process and then start your script again and if a
          task with the same project name is running, this ``b2luigi`` ``gbasf2`` wrapper will recognize that
          and instead of resubmitting a new project, continue monitoring the running project.

          .. hint::
            The outputs of ``gbasf2`` tasks can be a bit overwhelming, so I recommend using the
            :ref:`central scheduler <central-scheduler-label>`
            which provides a nice overview of all tasks in the browser, including a status/progress
            indicator how many jobs in a ``gbasf2`` project are already done.

        - **Automatic download of datasets and logs**

          If all jobs had been successful, it automatically downloads the output dataset and
          the log files from the job sandboxes and automatically checks if the download was successful
          before moving the data to the final location. On failure, it only downloads the logs.
          The dataset download can be optionally disabled.

        - **Automatic rescheduling of failed jobs**

          Whenever a job fails, ``gbasf2`` reschedules it as long as the number of retries is below the
          value of the setting ``gbasf2_max_retries``. It keeps track of the number of retries in a
          local file in the ``log_file_dir``, so that it does not change if you close ``b2luigi`` and start it again.
          Of course it does not persist if you remove that file or move to a different machine.

    .. note::
       Despite all the automatization that this ``gbasf2`` wrapper provides, the user is expected to
       have a basic understanding of how the grid works and know the basics of working
       with ``gbasf2`` commands manually.

    Caveats
        - The ``gbasf2`` batch process for luigi can only be used for tasks
          inheriting from :class:`Basf2PathTask <b2luigi.basf2_helper.Basf2PathTask>` or other tasks with a
          ``create_path()`` method that returns a ``basf2`` path.
        - It can be used **only for picklable ``basf2`` paths**, with only some limited global ``basf2`` state
          saved (currently aliases and global tags). The batch process stores
          the path created by ``create_path`` in a python pickle file and runs that on the grid.
          Therefore, **python ``basf2`` modules are not yet supported**.
          To see if the path produced by a steering file is picklable, you can try to dump it with
          ``basf2 --dump-path`` and execute it again with ``basf2 --execute-path``.
          In case the steering file contains content (e.g. modules) that cannot be pickled, the feature setting
          ``gbasf2_custom_steering_file`` can be utilized which has to be set to the path of the steering file
          the user wishes to be used. This submits the custom steering file to the grid job. The specific use case
          for this is the usage and interaction with python-based ``basf2`` modules that are not pickable.
        - Output format: Changing the batch to ``gbasf2`` means you also have to
          adapt how you handle the output of your ``gbasf2`` task in tasks depending
          on it, because the output will not be a single root file anymore (e.g.
          ``B_ntuple.root``), but a collection of root files, one for each file in
          the input data set, in a directory with the base name of the root
          files, e.g.::

            <task output directory>
                        ├── B_ntuple.root
                        │   └── B_ntuple_0.root
                        │   └── B_ntuple_1.root
                        │   └── ...
                        ├── D_ntuple.root
                        │   └── D_ntuple_0.root
                        │   └── ...



    Settings for ``gbasf2`` tasks:
        To submit a task with the ``gbasf2`` wrapper, you first you have to add the property
        ``batch_system = "gbasf2"``, which sets the ``batch_system`` setting.
        It is not recommended to set that setting globally, as not all tasks can be submitted to the grid,
        but only tasks with a ``create_path`` method.

        For ``gbasf2`` tasks it is further required to set the settings

        - ``gbasf2_input_dataset``: String with the logical path of a dataset on the grid to use as an input to the task.
          You can provide multiple inputs by having multiple paths contained in this string, separated by commas without spaces.
          An alternative is to just instantiate multiple tasks with different input datasets, if you want to know in retrospect
          which input dataset had been used for the production of a specific output.
        - ``gbasf2_input_dslist``: Alternatively to ``gbasf2_input_dataset``, you can use this setting to provide a text file
          containing the logical grid path names, one per line.
        - ``gbasf2_project_name_prefix``: A string with which your ``gbasf2`` project names will start.
          To ensure the project associate with each unique task (i.e. for each of luigi parameters)
          is unique, the unique ``task.task_id`` is hashed and appended to the prefix
          to create the actual ``gbasf2`` project name.
          Should be below 22 characters so that the project name with the hash can remain
          under 32 characters.

        The following example shows a minimal class with all required options to run on the ``gbasf2``/grid batch:

        .. code-block:: python

           class MyTask(Basf2PathTask):
               batch_system = "gbasf2"
               gbasf2_project_name_prefix = b2luigi.Parameter(significant=False)
               gbasf2_input_dataset = b2luigi.Parameter(hashed=True)

        Other not required, but noteworthy settings are:

        - ``gbasf2_setup_path``: Path to ``gbasf2`` environment setup script that needs so be sourced to run ``gbasf2`` commands.
          Defaults to `/cvmfs/belle.kek.jp/grid/gbasf2/pro/bashrc`.
        - ``gbasf2_release``: Defaults to the release of your currently set up ``basf2`` release.
          Set this if you want the jobs to use another release on the grid.
        - ``gbasf2_proxy_lifetime``: Defaults to ``24``. When initializing a proxy, set the
          lifetime to this number of hours.
        - ``gbasf2_min_proxy_lifetime``: Defaults to ``0``. During processing, prompt user
          to reinitialize proxy if remaining proxy lifetime drops below this number of
          hours.
        - ``gbasf2_print_status_updates``: Defaults to ``True``. By setting it to ``False`` you can turn off the
          printing of of the job summaries, that is the number of jobs in different states in a ``gbasf2`` project.
        - ``gbasf2_max_retries``: Default to ``0``. Maximum number of times that each job in the project can be automatically
          rescheduled until the project is declared as failed.
        - ``gbasf2_proxy_group``: Default to ``"belle"``. If provided, the ``gbasf2`` wrapper will work with the custom ``gbasf2`` group,
          specified in this parameter. No need to specify this parameter in case of usual physics analysis at Belle II.
          If specified, one has to provide ``gbasf2_project_lpn_path`` parameter.
        - ``gbasf2_project_lpn_path``: Path to the LPN folder for a specified ``gbasf2`` group.
          The parameter has no effect unless the ``gbasf2_proxy_group`` is used with non-default value.
        - ``gbasf2_jinja_template_path``: This parameter sets a custom basf2 steering template where the user can adapt the
          default template (e.g. for altering the pdg database, ...). Note that this is an expert option that should be treated with care.
        - ``gbasf2_additional_download_params``: Defaults to ``"--new"``. This parameter sets additional parameters that
          are given to ``gb2_ds_get``. Note that in case you override the parameter, the ``--new`` parameter is not automatically set,
          so you might have to manually add ``--new`` if you want this parameter to be used.
        - ``gbasf2_download_dataset``: Defaults to ``True``. Disable this setting if you don't want to download the
          output dataset from the grid on job success. As you can't use the downloaded dataset as an output target for ``luigi``,
          you should then use the provided ``Gbasf2GridProjectTarget``, as shown in the following example:

          .. code-block:: python

            from b2luigi.batch.processes.gbasf2 import get_unique_project_name, Gbasf2GridProjectTarget

            class MyTask(Basf2PathTask):
                # [...]
                def output(self):
                    project_name = get_unique_project_name(self)
                    return Gbasf2GridProjectTarget(project_name)

          This is useful when chaining ``gbasf2`` tasks together,
          as they don't need the output locally but take the grid datasets as input. Also useful when you just want
          to produce data on the grid for other people to use.

          .. caution::
            For ``Gbasf2GridProjectTarget``s the global and the task ``gbasf2_proxy_group`` cannot differ.

          .. tip::
            Set only one global ``gbasf2_proxy_group`` setting.

        - ``gbasf2_download_logs``: Whether to automatically download the log output of ``gbasf2`` projects when the
          task succeeds or fails. Having the logs is important for reproducibility.
        - ``gbasf2_custom_steering_file``: Optional path to submit a custom steering file to ``gbasf2``. This does not pickle the ``basf2.Path`` instance and allows the utilization of python-based basf2 modules. Named modules have to be contained either in the steering file itself or by additional files via the input sandbox.

        The following optional settings correspond to the equally named ``gbasf`` command line options
        (without the ``gbasf_`` prefix) that you can set to customize your ``gbasf2`` project:

        ``gbasf2_noscout``,
        ``gbasf2_additional_files``,
        ``gbasf2_input_datafiles``,
        ``gbasf2_n_repition_job``,
        ``gbasf2_force_submission``,
        ``gbasf2_cputime``,
        ``gbasf2_evtpersec``,
        ``gbasf2_priority``,
        ``gbasf2_jobtype``,
        ``gbasf2_basf2opt``,
        ``gbasf2_lfn_sandboxfiles``,
        ``gbasf2_input_grouping``

        It is further possible to append arbitrary command line arguments to the ``gbasf2`` submission command
        with the ``gbasf2_additional_params`` setting.
        If you want to blacklist a grid site, you can e.g. add

        .. code-block:: python

          b2luigi.set_setting("gbasf2_additional_params",  "--banned_site LCG.KEK.jp")


    Example
        Here is an example file to submit an analysis path created by the script in
        `examples/gbasf2/example_mdst_analysis` to grid via ``gbasf2``:

        .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/gbasf2/gbasf2_example.py
           :caption: File: ``examples/gbasf2/gbasf2_example.py``
           :linenos:

    Handling failed jobs
        The ``gbasf2`` input wrapper considers the ``gbasf2`` project as failed if any of
        the jobs in the project failed and reached the maximum number of retries.
        It then automatically downloads the logs, so please look into them to see what the reason was.
        For example, it can be that only certain grid sites were affected, so you might want to exclude them
        by adding the ``"--banned_site ...`` to ``gbasf2_additional_params``.

        You also always reschedule jobs manually with the ``gb2_job_reschedule`` command or delete them with
        ``gb2_job_delete`` so that the ``gbasf2`` batch process doesn't know they ever
        existed. Then run just run your luigi task/script again and it will start monitoring the running project
        again.
