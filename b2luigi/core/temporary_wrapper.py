        **Redefinitions**:

        - ``get_output_file_name``

          Retrieves or creates a temporary output file for the given key.

          If the file corresponding to the specified key is not already open, this method
          generates a temporary file path using the task's :meth:`b2luigi.Task._get_output_target` and
          :meth:`b2luigi.Target.temporary_path` methods, and opens the file within the context of the
          task.

          Args:
              key (str): The unique identifier for the output file.

              tmp_file_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the :meth:`b2luigi.Target.temporary_path` method.

          Returns:
              The opened temporary file associated with the given key.

        - ``get_input_file_names``

          Retrieves the input file names associated with a given key, ensuring that the files are
          temporarily available for processing. Behaves the same as :meth:`b2luigi.Task.get_input_file_names`.

          Args:
              key (str): The identifier for the input files to retrieve.

              tmp_file_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to pass to the :meth:`b2luigi.Target.get_temporary_input` method of the target.

          Returns:
              list: A list of opened temporary input files corresponding to the given key.

          Notes:
              - If the ``n_download_threads`` setting is specified, the input files are fetched
                concurrently using a thread pool.
              - If ``n_download_threads`` is not specified, the input files are fetched sequentially.

        - ``get_input_file_names_from_dict``

          Retrieves input file names from a dictionary structure, handling temporary file paths.
          Behaves the same as :meth:`b2luigi.Task.get_input_file_names_from_dict`.

          Args:
              requirement_key (str): The key used to identify the required input in the task's input dictionary.

              key (Optional[str], optional): A specific key to extract targets from the target dictionary. If ``None``, all targets are retrieved. Defaults to ``None``.

              tmp_file_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to the :meth:`b2luigi.Target.get_temporary_input` method for generating temporary file paths.

          Returns:
              list: A list of temporary file paths corresponding to the input files.

          Raises:
              KeyError: If the specified `key` is not found in the target dictionary.

def on_temporary_files(run_function):
    """
    Wrapper for decorating a task's run function to use temporary files as outputs.

    A common problem when using long running tasks in ``luigi`` is the so called thanksgiving bug
    (see https://www.arashrouhani.com/luigi-budapest-bi-oct-2015/#/21).
    It occurs, when you define an output of a task and in its run function,
    you create this output before filling it with content
    (maybe even only after a long lasting calculation).
    It may happen, that during the creation of the output and the finish of the calculation
    some other tasks checks if the output is already there, finds it and assumes,
    that the task is already finished (although there is probably only non-sense in the file
    so far).

    A solution is already given by luigi itself, when using the ``temporary_path()`` function
    of the file system targets, which is really nice!
    Unfortunately, this means you have to open all your output files with a context manager
    and this is very hard to do if you have external tasks also (because they will
    probably use the output file directly instead of the temporary file version of if).

    This wrapper simplifies the usage of the temporary files:

    .. code-block:: python

      import b2luigi

      class MyTask(b2luigi.Task):
          def output(self):
              yield self.add_to_output("test.txt")

          @b2luigi.on_temporary_files
          def run(self):
              with open(self.get_output_file_name("test.txt"), "w") as f:
                  raise ValueError()
                  f.write("Test")

    Instead of creating the file "test.txt" at the beginning and filling it with content
    later (which will never happen because of the exception thrown, which makes the file
    existing but the task actually not finished), the file will be written to a temporary
    file first and copied to its final location at the end of the run function (but only if there
    was no error).

    Warning:
        The decorator only edits the function :meth:`b2luigi.Task.get_output_file_name`. If you are using
        the output directly, you have to take care of using the temporary path correctly by yourself!
