``b2luigi`` is a helper package constructed around ``luigi`` that helps you schedule working packages (so-called
tasks) locally or on a batch system.
Apart from the very powerful dependency management system by ``luigi``, ``b2luigi`` extends the user interface
and has a built-in support for the queue systems, e.g. LSF and HTCondor.

You can find more information in the `documentation <https://b2luigi.belle2.org/>`_.
Please note that most of the core features are handled by ``luigi``, which is described in the separate
`luigi documentation <https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, where you can find a lot of useful information.

If you find any bugs or want to add a feature or improve the documentation, please send me a pull request!
Check the `development documentation <https://b2luigi.belle2.org/advanced/development.html>`_ on information how
